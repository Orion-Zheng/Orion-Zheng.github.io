Hello ! I’m Zian(Andy) Zheng, an AI enthusiast on a quest for challenges and unexplored horizons. As a Master’s student, I’m always eager to push boundaries and embrace novel ideas. Beyond the tech realm, I thrive on adrenaline-fueled outdoor pursuits like skydiving, scuba diving, free diving, climbing, and kayaking. Whether it’s conquering algorithms or mountains, I relish every opportunity to grow, learn, and adapt. 

Research Interest:
------
I have a deep interest in the Large Language Model (LLM), especially in the following areas:
- Data-Centric Approaches: Focusing on data quality and data strategies (e.g. Data Mixture and Data Curriculum)
- Efficient LLM Design and Training: MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) Model, Efficient Context Extrapolation Method.
- Maximizing Trained LLM Availability/Capability: Efficient Inference, Prompt Engineering, LLM-based Agent.
