Hello ! I’m Zian(Andy) Zheng, an AI enthusiast on a quest for challenges and unexplored horizons.

- As a Master’s student in National University of Singapore(NUS), I’m always eager to push boundaries and embrace novel ideas. 

- Beyond the study, I thrive on adrenaline-fueled outdoor pursuits like skydiving, scuba diving, free diving, climbing, and kayaking. 

Whether it’s conquering algorithms or mountains, I relish every opportunity to grow, learn, and adapt.

Research Interests
------
I have a deep interest in the Large Language Model (LLM), especially in the following areas:
- Data-Centric Approaches: Focusing on data quality and data strategies (e.g. Data Mixture and Data Curriculum)
- Efficient LLM Design and Training: MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) Model, Efficient Context Extrapolation Method.
- Maximizing Trained LLM Availability/Capability: Efficient Inference, Prompt Engineering, LLM-based Agent.

Miscellaneous
------
Here are some interesting facts about me: 
- I have the fortune to be Newton's 18th generation of students. The acadamic family tree is [here](/images/AcademicFamilyTree.png).
- I am an extreme sports lover and adrenaline junkie. You can call me 'Tri-diver Andy'([skydiver](/images/USPA-A.jpeg), [freediver](/images/AIDA-2star.png), [scuba diver](/images/AOW.jpg)), as this represents my achievements in scuba diving, free diving, and skydiving.
- I like writing poems(in English/Chinese). For example, [here](/images/poem.png) is one of my poems about life and love(yet-to-be-discovered).
